I've enhanced the authentication system with the following features:

    Remember Me:
        Stores user session in localStorage when "Remember Me" is checked
        Auto-loads saved session on app start

    Password Validation:
        Minimum 8 characters
        Must contain uppercase and lowercase letters
        Must contain at least one number
        Confirms password match during registration

    Forgot Password Flow:
        Dedicated forgot password form
        Simulated email reset flow (in a real app, this would send an email)
        Password reset functionality (token-based)

    Sign Up:
        New user registration form
        Name, email, and password validation
        Smooth toggle between login and signup forms

    Enhanced Error Handling:
        Displays validation errors
        Shows loading states
        Proper error messages for all scenarios

    Security Features:
        Password visibility toggle
        Secure password storage simulation
        Form validation

    UI Improvements:
        Clean, professional design
        Loading states
        Error messages
        Responsive layout

To test the system:

    Use any email/password for login (it's simulated)
    Try the "Remember Me" checkbox to persist the session
    Test the password validation in the registration form
    Try the forgot password flow
